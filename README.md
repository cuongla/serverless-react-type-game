A simple serverless React typing game application where users can compete with each other for typing speed.

# Serverless React Application

## Front-End

**React**: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

**React Hooks**: functions that let us hook into the React state and lifecycle features from function components.

**Styled-Components**: a library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application that are written with a mixture of JavaScript and CSS using a technique called CSS-in-JS.

## Back-End

**Netlify Functions**: Serverless functions built into every Netlify account. No setup, servers, or ops required. FYI: https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/

## APIs

**Airtable API**: an easy-to-use online platform for creating and sharing relational databases. The user interface is simple, colorful, friendly, and allows anyone to spin up a database in minutes.

**Auth0**: a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications.
